<b><center>Penicillin</center></b>
Penicillin is a medicine that is first discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. It was discovered
when a certain type of mold was accidently introduced to Staphylococcus colonies. Surprisingly,
the mold actually caused colonies to get smaller.
<br>
<br>
One of the most important medicines used to treat bacteria, penicillin works by destroying the
peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria. To do this, the medicine binds to the enzyme transpeptidase,
an enzyme that is responsible for cross-linking the peptidoglycan in cell wall. They are able to do
so because they share a similar shape with the usual substrate of the enzyme. Their overall structure
consist of one or more beta-lactam rings.

<br>
<br>
Once binding to transpeptidase, they will interfere with the process of cross-linking. This results
in cell walls not forming properly. This leads to holes within cell wall of bacterias.
Since most eukaryotic host organisms have a fluid-filled environment, where water concentration
will always be greater than prokaryote inner water concentration, cell wall malfunction results
in water diffusing inside prokaryotes. Too much water leads to cells bursting.
<br>
<br>
Penicillin are very important in treating against Gram positive bacterias such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.
This makes sense because a Gram positive bacteria relies on its thick peptidoglycan wall, which made it vulnerable
to mechanism of the drug. Although Gram negative bacterias are less susceptible, their thin peptidoglycan
wall also made treatment possible. For example, E. coli, a Gram negative bacteria, can be treated using
penicillin. Since human cells have no cell walls, we are not affected at all.
<br>
<br>
Despite how effective it can be, many bacterias can develop a way to resist the effect of penicillin.
One way was to produce enzymes that targets penicillin. Like transpeptidase, these enzymes have a high affinity
for this medicine, but unlike transpeptidase, these enzymes breaks the chemicals apart, rendering it
unable to affect transpeptidase.
<br>
<br>
Another resistance mechanism was to alter the shapes of transpeptidase. Altering an enzyme's structure can lead
to its active site, which is significant because it also involves the overall physiological change
for bacteria's entire structure. Now, the medicine no longer has similar shape as the normal substrate,
and penicillin lost its effect.
<br>
<br>
Finally, bacteria can simply get penicillin out of its system before it can do damage. This is done via
efflux pumps, which are pathways situated near the membranes. Like our sodium-potassium pump,
it uses ATP to drive harmful chemicals out of bacterial cell.
<br>
<br>
In 1991, T. J. Coffrey and seven other scientists made an experiment, where they gathered multiple copies
of penicillin resistant individuals of Streptococcus pneumoniae and analyzed their DNA.
They found out that they all share a certain allele, which was almost completely the same in
all resistant individuals. It is speculated that this gene was the one that allows the bacteria
to create an enzyme that bind and deactivate penicillin. Their beliefs are further reinforced when they used a penicillin-vulnerable Streptococcus as a control
and comparison, and failed to find such allele in the control group. They believe these alleles
came from horizontal transfer, most likely conjugation, between resistant groups and non-resistant groups. (Coffrey et al. 1991)

<br>
<br>
From this study, I can see that selection pressure generated by penicillin caused the overall allele frequencies
for antibiotic-resistant genes to dominate, to the point of almost completely replacing the natural wild-type
genes, achieving a near 100% fixation.
