<b><center>Macrolides</center></b>
<br>
Macrolide is a medicine that is first discovered in 1950s, when erythromycin are isolated
from Streptomyces bacteria. Their structures consists of several lactone rings with many more
sugars surrounding them. This antibiotics is unique in that not only are they used to treat human infections,
but they are also used when raising farm animals. As a result, they tends to breed bacteria resistance
very quickly.

Like penicillin, macrolide are also used to treat many types of bacterial infection, with greatest
emphasis on Gram positive bacteria. They also mimics a bacterial enzyme's usual substrates.
But unlike penicilin though, this medicine uses a different route
of inhibiting bacteria growth. Instead of transpeptidase, they bind to peptidyltransferase.
This enzyme serves to add new amino acids to protein. Without proteins, a bacteria cannot function
or reproduce.

<br>
Although both our cells and bacteria cells have ribosomes, our ribosomes are different. Bacteria
uses a smaller 70S ribosome, compared to the bigger 80S ribosomes used by us. This subtle difference
allows Macrolides to target only bacteria chromosomes.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as with all antibiotics, macrolides can be resisted. One of the most prevalent method
that this can occur
is by changing the shapes of both its enzyme, as well as all essential molecules such as rRNA and tRNA.
This change leads to peptidyltransferase not recognizing macrolide, and will not bind to it.
<br>
<br>
In 2001, Birte Vester and Stephen Douthwaite investigated two strains of bacteria: a wild type that occurs in
nature, and the special, antibiotic resistant strains. They found out that the two strains of bacteria
have a different nucleotide at a specific position within rRNA. (Vester and Douthwaite 2001)

What was significant about this result is that
these nucelotide at said position
is shared across all resistant bacteria that belong to same species, but they are different within two separate
bacteria species. From this, it can be deduced that bacteria may selectively transfer genes within own species.
If that is the case, then it is highly likely conjugation was involved rather than transformation,
where bacteria mate with another bacteria that is most similar to themselves.

This associative mating will result in each species resisting antibiotics in a different way, which to an extent maintains
the polymorphism
