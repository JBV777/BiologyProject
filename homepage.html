<center> <b>How does development of antibiotics affect population genetics structure of pathogenic bacterias, and what causes such effect? </b></center>

From the literature survey conducted, we looked at different antibiotics, and how the population genetics of
pathogenic bacteria changes as antibiotics are introduced. Before antibiotics are introduced,
there are a wide diversity of genes exhibited by pathogenic bacteria. Due to its fast reproduction rate,
mutation may happen a lot, and it is entirely possible that antibiotic resistant genes have long been within
pathogen population. However, they are not predominant, but instead are maintained as a part of polymorphism of traits within population.
<br>
<br>
As antibiotic gets developed, a selective pressure was generated, with the agent that is doing the selection being
the antibiotic itself. This leads to the increased fitness of antibiotic-resistant genes.
<br>
<br>

For those who are not antibiotic-resistant, they either gets eliminated, or they adopt the genes of their higher fit peers.
It is suggested that conjugation is the most common way that bacteria do this, which involves
a bridge serving as pathway for DNA to be transfered. In addition, transformation is possible, as
a bacteria can release all its genes into the environment, leaving others to take in the left over genetic
material.
<br>
<br>

This process is not without cost, however. The presence of this selective pressure has
caused all surviving pathogens to adopt a common allele at the essential sites. The loss of
polymorphism is apparant, as the resistant alleles undergo fixation leads to many other genes
becoming extinct from population.
<br>
<br>

This topic is very important because it not only allows us to get a deeper understanding of bacterias and antibiotics,
but it also allows us to potentially develop a more effective method of treating bacteria in the future.
