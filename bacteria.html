<i>"If you know the enemy and yourself, you need not to fear result of 100 battles" -- Sun Tzu</i>
<br>
<br>
Before we talk about antibiotics, we will first need to know about bacterias, the very target antibiotics are made to defeat.
<br>
<br>
Bacterias are a microorganisms that comprises of almost two-third of biodiversity exhibited by
Earth. They are prokaryotes that is made up a single cell, with little short hairs called cilia
around them. Some bacterias may also have flagella at the tail, which are long filaments that helps bacteria to swim
across liquid like mediums within many host species.
<br>
<br>
Bacteria cell can be compared to eukaryotic cells. Like our own cells, they have a nucleus where DNA is concentrated;
ribosomes within its cytoplasm that makes protein, and a cell membrane around them. Unlike
our cells, however, they do not have organelles such as Golgi Apparatus or mitochondria. Most
importantly, though, they have a cell wall, which are used to hold their structures togeher and protect
them against osmotic pressures.
<br>
<br>
Cell walls can be used to classify bacterias into two types: Gram positive and Gram negative.
Gram positive bacteria have a large and thick peptidoglycan wall, but they lack an outer membrane;
whereas Gram negative cell walls have a significantly smaller peptidoglycan wall, but they also
have two layers of membrane covering them.

<br>
<br>
These characteristics each conveys a different evolutionary advantage. For Gram positive
bacteria, their thick peptidoglycan wall makes it more adaptive to surviving against osmotic
environments, as it protects them from gaining too much water or lose too much water. On the other hand,
Gram negative bacteria is also significantly more difficult to combat using antibiotics, due to
many properties exhibited by their outer membrane. In fact, many of the most notorious "superbugs"
have a Gram negative structure.

<br>
<br>
Another unique features seen in bacterias are its plasmids. Plasmids are a region of genes
that are non-essential to bacterias everyday function. They do not produce energy, nor do they produce
protein. However, they are also one of the most important and well-studied area of bacteria.
The reason for this is because they usually contains genes that helps a group of bacteria to survive their
changing environment. Through conjugation, a bridge occurs between two bacterias, which allows
a part of bacteria 1 plasmid to go into bacteria 2 plasmid. This essentially allows the traits with greatest
evolutionary fitness to be easily passed on from one to another.

<br>
<br>
Another two ways that bacteria can do this is by transformation and transduction. Transformation is when
genes from one bacteria leaks out and gets absorbed by another bacteria, whereas transduction involves
a virus serving as a transportation tool that uses infections to spread its genes around.
As we will see in this project, these transmission methods are essential in how bacteria responds to
antibiotics.

<br>
<br>

Not all bacterias are pathogenic, as most of them actually helps us in performing out own essential functions.
However, they may become harmful once our immune system is down. They are considered to be one of the most dangerous
pathogens because as they multiple without constraint, they also produces toxins that can overwhelm and shut down
body function. An example of this is E. Coli: the bacteria can create Shiga toxin that prevents protein from being made
by our own cells.
<br>
<br>
In addition to toxins, their mere presence can cause our immune system to activate. This activation can
sometimes bring about very dangerous symptoms, some may even be severe enough to be fatal.
For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that invades host's respiratory systems.
They are deadly because when our immune system detects them, an inflammation happens within lungs
in a desperate attempt to fight off infections. This results in pneumonia, and the loss of function
by alveoli.
